# InteractiveDictionary
This is a basic type of dictionary which is created in Python over here using a Dataset(Data.json ) which i had puled off the web after doing some research 
so what it aims to do is to act like a dictionary app on your device .
and it achiebes that by using the dataset(Data.json) which happens as follows:
1.First we load our data using the json module as a dictionary containing key-value
2. we create our translate function which takes in the parameters w
3.we take input of w(which is the word we are trying to search)
4.we convert w into lower case
5.now we search for w in data :
if we find it we print 
else we print the message the word no found.
